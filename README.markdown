# OpenFlame Dbal

The OpenFlame Database Abstraction Layer is a library that interacts with the database and is used to power OpenFlame CMS and FireTracker.

This simple, yet powerful Database abstraction layer sites a top of PHP's PDO functionality to provide automated methods in building queries, escaping data, import/export in a DMBS-neutral format, and schema versioning.
